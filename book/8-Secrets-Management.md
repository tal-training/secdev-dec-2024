 # Secrets Management üîë

Secrets management is a crucial aspect of application security that involves protecting sensitive information such as passwords, keys, tokens, and other authentication credentials. In this lesson, we will explore different subtopics related to secrets management: _Understanding Application Secrets_, _Safely Storing Secrets in Development_, _Protecting Production Secrets_, _Identity and Access Management (IAM)_, _Authentication_, _Authorization_, _OAuth 2.0_, _OpenID Connect (OIDC)_, _JSON Web Tokens (JWT)_, and _JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)_.

## Understanding Application Secrets üîí

Application secrets refer to any sensitive information that is required to operate an application, but should not be made publicly available. This includes credentials for databases, API keys, encryption keys, and other sensitive data. Understanding the importance of application secrets is vital for ensuring security in both development and production environments.

A common example of application secrets are database credentials. Developers often store these credentials directly within their codebase or use them as environment variables. However, this practice poses a significant risk since these credentials can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the codebase or environment variables.

To mitigate this risk, best practices recommend storing application secrets in secure environments like a _secrets manager_ service or an encrypted file that is not accessible via version control systems. By doing so, you limit the number of individuals who have access to these sensitive details and reduce the attack surface for potential threats.

## Safely Storing Secrets in Development üíª

In development environments, storing secrets can be a tricky task as there is often a need to share access to secrets among team members or integrate with external services. One approach for safely storing secrets during development includes using a _secrets manager_ like Hashicorp's `Vault`, `Kubernetes Secrets`, or AWS Secrets Manager.

Secrets managers store and manage sensitive data securely, providing access controls, auditing, and encryption capabilities. By using a secrets manager, developers can avoid hard-coding secrets into their codebase and simplify the process of sharing secrets among team members. Additionally, these services often support integrations with popular development tools and platforms, making it easier to manage secrets throughout your development workflow.

An example of a use case for storing secrets in a secrets manager during development is when setting up integration tests. In this scenario, you can securely store the credentials for third-party APIs or services used by your tests without exposing them within your codebase. By doing so, you maintain security while still allowing your tests to execute properly.

## Protecting Production Secrets üîê

Protecting production secrets is arguably more important than safeguarding those in development environments due to the higher risk associated with production breaches. In a production environment, sensitive information could result in unauthorized access, data leaks, or other malicious activity that could negatively impact your organization and its customers.

One way to protect production secrets is by implementing strong access controls to your infrastructure using services like _IAM roles_, _access policies_, and _firewalls_. You should limit the number of individuals who have access to these sensitive details, ensure they are properly trained in security best practices, and provide multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

Another technique for protecting production secrets is implementing _encryption_ for data at rest and in transit. By encrypting your sensitive data using robust encryption algorithms like AES or RSA, you limit the potential impact of a breach as unauthorized users would need to decrypt the data before being able to access it.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) üîã

Identity and Access Management (IAM) refers to a framework that enables organizations to manage digital identities and their access to resources within an infrastructure. IAM consists of several components, including _authentication_, _authorization_, and _identity providers_.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity, often a user, prior to granting them access to resources. This can be achieved using methods like _username/password_ or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Authorization refers to the process of determining what level of access an authenticated entity is granted to specific resources within your infrastructure. Access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) are examples of authorization mechanisms that allow you to define who can access what resources and under which conditions.

Now, let's explore some popular standards and technologies used in IAM: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)...
