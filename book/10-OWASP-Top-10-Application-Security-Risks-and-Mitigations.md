 # OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks and Mitigations

In this secure development course, we will cover the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks and Mitigations. The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical risks to web applications, and addressing these risks can significantly improve the security of your applications. Let's dive into each of the subsections:

## Injection (A1:2017)

### Description
Injection attacks occur when an attacker sends malicious data to a web application through input fields with the intent to execute malicious SQL, NoSQL or LDAP queries. This can lead to unintended actions, such as data theft or modification of data.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Input Validation: Validate all user inputs using appropriate techniques like regular expressions, length checks, and whitespace validation to ensure that data conforms to expected formats.
2. Prepared Statements: Use prepared statements in SQL queries and parameterized queries for NoSQL databases to separate the query from user input.
3. Output Encoding: Properly encode all user input before rendering it in a response, using encoding methods like HTML or URL encoding.

## Broken Authentication (A2:2017)

### Description
Broken authentication is a vulnerability that results from poor design or implementation of an application’s authentication feature. This could include easily guessable passwords, lack of salt in hashed passwords, or failure to enforce session timeouts and other security measures.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms: Implement multi-factor authentication for user accounts, which requires users to present multiple forms of identification to verify their identity.
2. Secure Session Management: Implement secure session management, such as setting proper timeout intervals, handling invalid sessions, and using encryption.
3. Password Complexity and Storage: Ensure that passwords are complex enough by enforcing a minimum length and character requirements. Store hashed passwords using industry-standard algorithms like bcrypt or PBKDF2 to protect user accounts from being compromised.

## Sensitive Data Exposure (A3:2017)

### Description
Sensitive Data Exposure refers to the improper handling, storage or transmission of sensitive information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other confidential data. This can lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Encryption: Implement encryption methods for both storing and transmitting sensitive information. Use industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES.
2. Access Control: Implement strict access control measures, such as role-based access or mandatory access control, to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
3. Data Minimization: Only store the minimum amount of data necessary for a given application, and avoid storing unnecessary information that can be used in attacks against your users or organization.

## XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerabilities (A6:2017)

### Description
XXE vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to manipulate an application’s handling of XML external entities, enabling them to read sensitive files, execute system commands, or even leak data.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Disable XML External Entity Processing: By default, disable XML External Entity processing in XML parsers used by your application. Use secure alternatives for data exchange and parsing, such as JSON.
2. Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that user inputs conform to expected formats and only include trusted entities.
3. Secure Configuration: Apply security configuration settings and best practices, such as using a white list of allowed external entities, to prevent attackers from exploiting XML vulnerabilities in your application.
