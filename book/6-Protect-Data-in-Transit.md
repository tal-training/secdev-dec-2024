 # **Protect Data in Transit**

In the realm of application security, ensuring data confidentiality while it's being transmitted between different systems and endpoints is a crucial aspect of maintaining a secure environment. This section will focus on several key topics related to protecting data during transmission: Transport Security Overview, SSL vs TLS, The TLS Handshake, Certificates, SSL Offloading and Termination, and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

## **1. Transport Security Overview**

Transport security is a set of measures designed to ensure the secure exchange of data between communicating applications over public networks, like the internet. It includes technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) that provide encryption, data integrity, and authentication for data in transit. The primary goal is to protect against eavesdropping, interception, modification, and tampering of information being transmitted between parties.

## **Example Use Case:**

Imagine a web-based e-commerce platform where customers enter sensitive data like credit card details or personal information for a purchase. The security team needs to ensure that this data is protected from interception during transit between the user's browser and their servers. By implementing transport security solutions like SSL/TLS, they can secure the data exchange, safeguarding valuable customer information and maintaining trust.

## **Risks:**

Without proper transport security measures in place, data in transit is susceptible to various threats:

1. Eavesdropping - Unauthorized access to data through interception of communications.
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks - An attacker can inject malicious code or steal sensitive information by impersonating both parties involved in the communication.
3. Data modification - Maliciously changing transmitted data during transfer.

## **2. SSL vs TLS**

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over computer networks by providing three essential properties: authentication, encryption, and message integrity. The primary difference between the two is that SSL is an older protocol with known vulnerabilities, while TLS has addressed those weaknesses.

## **TLS Versions:**

TLS has evolved through several versions since its introduction as an improvement upon SSL. Some notable versions include:

1. TLS 1.0 - First release of TLS in November 1999. Known to have significant vulnerabilities.
2. TLS 1.1 - Released in February 2006, includes improvements over TLS 1.0.
3. TLS 1.2 - Released in January 2008, offers the most comprehensive security features and is currently widely used.
4. TLS 1.3 - The latest version as of this writing, released in August 2018, offering increased performance and security enhancements.

## **Comparing SSL and TLS:**

Though SSL and TLS serve the same purpose, there are differences between them:

1. Authentication: Both use certificates for mutual authentication; however, TLS offers more robust certificate handling methods.
2. Encryption: SSL uses 40-bit or 128-bit encryption, while TLS supports stronger algorithms like AES and RSA.
3. Security: TLS includes better key exchange mechanisms and supports perfect forward secrecy (PFS).

## **3. The TLS Handshake**

The TLS handshake is a secure method for initiating an encrypted connection between two communicating applications. During the handshake process, both parties negotiate and agree upon the cryptographic methods to be used for the session and exchange necessary data (like public keys and session keys). Once established, data transmitted over the session will remain confidential and protected against eavesdropping or modification.

## **TLS Handshake Steps:**

1. The client sends a "hello" message, which includes its supported TLS versions, encryption methods, and certificate information.
2. The server responds with its own capabilities and the selected version and encryption method.
3. Each side validates their respective certificates and generates a symmetric key to be used for session encryption.
4. The client and server exchange additional messages to confirm successful completion of the handshake process and establish the secure connection.

## **4. Certificates**

Certificates are essential components in providing secure communication via SSL/TLS. They contain information that helps validate the identity of communicating parties and enable encryption. X.509 is the most common certificate format used by both SSL and TLS.

## **Certificate Structure:**

A typical certificate contains:

1. Issuer name and signature: Identifies the entity issuing the certificate.
2. Subject name: Defines the entity to which the certificate is issued.
3. Validity period: Indicates the start and expiration dates of the certificate's validity.
4. Public key: Used for encryption and decryption, unique to each certificate.
5. Serial number: A unique identifier to help distinguish between different certificates issued by the same CA (Certificate Authority).
6. Signature algorithm: Specifies the method used to sign the certificate.

## **Certificate Usage:**

Certificates play a critical role in securing communication by ensuring both authentication and encryption:

1. Authentication: Certificates serve as digital identification cards, confirming the identity of the communicating parties.
2. Encryption: After establishing the secure connection through the certificate exchange, data transmitted between the two parties will be encrypted using the public key contained within the certificate.

## **5. SSL Offloading and Termination**

SSL offloading refers to the process of moving the encryption and decryption tasks from a web application server (or application proxy) to an external device, usually an appliance or load balancer. This practice can help alleviate server processing overhead and improve overall performance for applications handling large amounts of traffic. SSL termination involves establishing and managing the SSL connection on the offloading device, with secure communication continuing over non-encrypted channels between the application servers and their clients.

## **Benefits of Offloading:**

Some advantages to implementing SSL offloading include:

1. Performance Improvement: By handling the encryption/decryption tasks off the server, you can improve overall application performance.
2. Scalability: Handling more SSL requests through an external device is easier and less resource-intensive than doing it directly on the application servers.
3. Simplified Management: Centralizing SSL management and configuration can make it easier to maintain secure communication for multiple applications.

## **6. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security enhancement that helps ensure web communication between the client and server remains encrypted at all times, preventing potential downgrade attacks from intermediaries. When implemented on a website or application, HSTS instructs the browser to only use secure (encrypted) connections for future requests with the domain.

## **How It Works:**

When an HSTS-enabled site sends its initial SSL-secured response to the client, it includes the following directive in its HTTP headers:

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<number_of_seconds>; includeSubDomains; preload`

This header instructs the browser to only use secure connections for all future requests to that domain and any subdomains for the specified duration (max-age) and to cache this preference. The 'preload' attribute indicates that the site should be added to a list of HSTS sites maintained by major browsers to ensure enforcement even during initial navigation.

## **Security Benefits:**

HSTS provides several benefits:

1. Prevents Downgrade Attacks: Ensures secure connections are used at all times, preventing attackers from forcing insecure communication between the client and server.
2. Simplifies Management: Allows web administrators to enforce HTTPS site-wide with just a few configuration changes.
3. Browser Support: Major browsers now support HSTS by default, making it an effective measure for securing websites and applications.
