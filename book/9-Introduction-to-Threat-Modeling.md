 # **Introduction to Threat Modeling**

## **What is Threat Modeling?**

Threat modeling is a systematic process used to identify, prioritize, and address potential cybersecurity threats to an application or system. It helps teams understand the risks associated with their systems and develop strategies to mitigate those risks. By visualizing potential attacks and considering the motivations and capabilities of attackers, threat modeling allows developers, team leaders, system architects, and security personnel to proactively design more secure applications and infrastructure.

Threat modeling can be applied at various stages of a project, from the initial planning phase to ongoing maintenance and updates. It's an essential skill for anyone involved in building or maintaining software systems, as it enables teams to make informed decisions about where to focus their security efforts and allocate resources accordingly. For example, threat modeling helped the team behind the popular video game "Minecraft" identify vulnerabilities early on in development, saving them significant time and resources in the long run.

## **Threat Modeling Approaches**

There are several approaches to threat modeling, each with its own benefits and use cases. Three common approaches are:

### 1. **STRIDE:**
 STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Raising Privileges, Injection, DoS, and Elevation of Privilege) is a popular threat modeling approach used to identify potential threats against an application's functionality. It involves analyzing each component of the system and determining whether it is vulnerable to any of these six types of attacks.

### Example:
 Consider a simple web application that allows users to create accounts, reset passwords, and log in. An attacker using the STRIDE approach might consider how they could tamper with user input (Injection), elevate their privileges (Elevation of Privilege) by exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication system, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overwhelming the server with traffic.

### 2. **DREAD:**
 DREAD (Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability) is another threat modeling approach that assesses threats based on their impact, likelihood of occurrence, and the resources required to exploit them. This approach can help teams prioritize security efforts by focusing on the most significant threats first.

### Example:
 Using the DREAD approach, an attacker might target a system with high damage potential (critical infrastructure), low reproducibility (hard to detect), moderate exploitability (requiring some technical knowledge), a large affected user base (millions of users), and relatively easy discoverability (widespread use of the application). This threat would be considered particularly dangerous, as it has the potential for significant damage with minimal investment from the attacker.

## **Threat Modeling Methodologies**

Various methodologies have been developed to help teams apply threat modeling effectively in their projects. Some common ones include:

### 1. **CTM (Context-Threat Modeling):**
 CTM is a comprehensive threat modeling methodology that involves first understanding the context and goals of the application, then identifying and assessing potential threats based on the STRIDE approach. This methodology includes creating visual models of the system and its components to aid in threat identification and analysis.

### Example:
 In the case of a banking application, CTM might involve modeling user interactions (login, account creation, transfer funds), identifying attacker motivations (financial gain, identity theft), and analyzing potential threats using STRIDE (Tampering with login credentials or injecting malicious SQL statements).

### 2. **Past Attacks:**
 The "Past Attacks" methodology involves examining known attacks that have occurred against similar systems in the past and applying those lessons to current projects. This approach can help teams learn from the mistakes of others, identify emerging threats, and apply proven security strategies to their own applications.

### Example:
 By studying publicly available information about high-profile data breaches (e.g., Equifax, Target), a team could identify common attack vectors (SQL injection attacks) and develop appropriate countermeasures (input validation, parameterized queries). This knowledge could then be applied to their own projects to improve overall security.

## **Improve Application Security with Threat Modeling**

Effective threat modeling can significantly improve application security by helping teams:

1. **Understand potential threats:** Threat modeling provides a systematic way to identify potential vulnerabilities and prioritize them based on their impact, likelihood of occurrence, and the resources required to exploit them.

2. **Design more secure applications**: By understanding the motivations and capabilities of attackers, teams can design applications that are less vulnerable to common attack vectors. Threat modeling also helps identify security requirements early in the development process.

3. **Improve collaboration between team members**: Threat modeling encourages interdisciplinary collaboration by involving developers, system architects, security personnel, and other stakeholders in the process of securing applications. This can lead to better communication, increased awareness of security issues, and a more holistic approach to application security.
