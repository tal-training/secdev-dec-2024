**Exercise: Designing a Threat Model**

**Scenario:** You are the security architect for a company that is developing an online banking platform. The
platform will allow customers to manage their accounts, transfer funds, and pay bills.

**Requirements:**

1. The platform must support multiple login methods (e.g., username/password, biometric authentication).
2. Customers can have multiple accounts with varying levels of access.
3. The platform must provide a secure way for customers to view and manage their account information.
4. The company must comply with regulatory requirements for online banking transactions.

**Design Exercise:**

Please answer the following questions in 30 minutes:

1. **Threat Identification:** Identify potential threats to the online banking platform, including:
        * Data breaches
        * Unauthorized access to customer accounts
        * Identity theft
        * Insider threats (e.g., employees or contractors with malicious intentions)
2. **Data Flow Diagrams:** Create a data flow diagram (DFD) for the online banking platform, showing how sensitive
data flows through the system.
        * What types of data are collected and stored?
        * How is customer information transmitted between systems?
3. **Attack Surfaces:** Identify potential attack surfaces in the online banking platform, including:
        * Network vulnerabilities
        * System weaknesses (e.g., outdated software or operating systems)
        * Data storage vulnerabilities
4. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a risk assessment for each identified threat, considering factors such as:
        * Likelihood of occurrence
        * Potential impact
        * Mitigation strategies
5. **Countermeasures:** Design countermeasures to mitigate the identified threats, including:
        * Technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems)
        * Administrative controls (e.g., access control policies, training programs)
        * Physical controls (e.g., secure storage of sensitive data)
