**Exercise: Secure Design Principles for Backend API**

**Objective:** Apply secure design principles for a backend API.

**Scenario:** You are a developer working on a new e-commerce platform that allows customers to place orders online. The platform uses a RESTful API to manage user accounts, products, and orders.

**Sensitive API Endpoints:**

1. **User Account Management**
        * `POST /users` (create a new user account)
        * `GET /users/{id}` (view a specific user account)
        * `PUT /users/{id}` (update a specific user account)
        * `DELETE /users/{id}` (delete a specific user account)
2. **Product Management**
        * `POST /products` (create a new product)
        * `GET /products/{id}` (view a specific product)
        * `PUT /products/{id}` (update a specific product)
        * `DELETE /products/{id}` (delete a specific product)
3. **Order Management**
        * `POST /orders` (place a new order)
        * `GET /orders/{id}` (view a specific order)
        * `PUT /orders/{id}` (update a specific order)
        * `DELETE /orders/{id}` (cancel a specific order)

** Bonus **

Design a protection system for secure storage of encryption keys.
