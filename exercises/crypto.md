**Exercise: Designing an Encrypted File Storage System**

**Objective:** As a software developer, you will design an encrypted file storage system for sensitive user data.
Your goal is to ensure that files stored on this system are protected from unauthorized access.

**Given Requirements:**

1. The storage system should store files of varying sizes (up to 10 GB).
2. Files must be encrypted before being stored.
3. Decryption should occur when a user requests to download or view a file.
4. Authentication is not required, but file integrity should be maintained.
5. File names and contents are sensitive information.

**Design Exercise:**

Please answer the following questions in 30 minutes:

1. What type of encryption algorithm (symmetric or asymmetric) would you use for this system? Justify your choice.
2. How would you store and manage the encryption keys used by the system?
3. Describe a secure key management approach that could be implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of encrypted files.
4. What security considerations would you take into account when designing the file storage architecture?
5. What measures would you implement to ensure the integrity and authenticity of stored files?
