**Exercise: Designing a Secrets Management System**

**Objective:** As a software developer, you will design a secrets management system to securely store and manage
sensitive data (secrets). Your goal is to ensure that secrets are protected from unauthorized access.

**Given Requirements:**

1. The system should store and manage multiple types of secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials, encryption
keys).
2. Secrets must be encrypted before being stored.
3. Decryption should occur when a secret is requested by an authorized application or user.
4. Access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict access to secrets based on user roles and
permissions.
5. The system should provide audit logs to track changes made to secrets.

**Design Exercise:**

Please answer the following questions in 30 minutes:

1. What type of encryption algorithm (symmetric or asymmetric) would you use for storing secrets? Justify your
choice.
2. Describe a secure key management approach that could be implemented to store and manage encryption keys used by
the system.
3. How would you implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to secrets based on user roles and
permissions?
4. What measures would you take to ensure the integrity and authenticity of stored secrets (e.g., hash-based
verification)?
5. Describe a logging mechanism that could be implemented to track changes made to secrets, including who accessed
or modified them.
